test.hb:4:18: unwrap is not needed since the value is (provably) never null, remove it, or replace with '@as(<expr_ty>, <opt_expr>)'
    ptr1 := @unwrap(always_nn)

test.hb:6:18: unwrap is incorrect since the value is (provably) always null, make sure your logic is correct
    ptr2 := @unwrap(always_n)
